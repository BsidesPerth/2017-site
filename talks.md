## A historical analysis of the security maturity of OpenSSH
### [By Matt Jones](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#matt-jones)
In this presentation, Matt will look at the security history of OpenSSH - software that has had high security requirements and exposure due to it being an integral part of computer systems worldwide for the past 17 years.

A detailed analysis of previous security vulnerabilities will be performed, looking at the trends in vulnerability research and the eras of vulnerability classes over the years.  Further to this, a review for how OpenSSH has steadily matured its security and incorporated defensive measures to combat attacks and make itself resilient to threats will be presented.   

A portion of the talk will look at the core concepts to generalise the key offensive and defensive principles to everything we see today.  In particular, as platform, framework, and application security is constantly evolving, what are the core concepts and approaches for us to understand well and share with others to help evolve application security collectively?

## Synergising The Internet of Everything And Fog Computing To Actualise The Cyber Perl Harbor: A Cross-silo Byod Approach to Dynamically Mitigating Next-Generation Watering Holes
### [By Fergal Conner & Gordon Erasmos](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#fergal-conner--gordon-erasmos)
The synergistically entanglement of cloud, the internet of everything and big data (CIOEBD) has proven to be a silver bullet solution to the problem of escalating infrastructure needs and right-sizing. Although the lining of this cloud isn't always silver and additional revolutionary approaches are required to actualise the cyber pearl harbour. Specifically cross-silo approaches are necessitated between these disruptive technologies to reap real world benefits in the area of next-generation watering hole mitigation.

In this presentation Mr. Conner and Mr. Erasmos will discuss a staged implementation of these technologies in a no nonsense manner, with real world examples, focusing on:
- Solution based enterprise security deployments
- Multi vector threat detection logic to leverage intelligence capital
- Countering the mission oriented adversary in the digital area of operation
- Sustainable information waste management technologies

## Bypass Techniques, because I am lazy
### [By Adam Foster aka Evildaemond](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#adam-foster-aka-evildaemond)
About 2 years ago, Adam made the discovery of lockpicking, about 2 days after that he purchased his first bypass tool, because why use the slower, less effective method when you can use the quick and efficient method? (Hint: Adam will explain why). In this talk, Adam will cover some of the basics of physical bypass techniques, how you can use this for fun and profit (and when your mates lose the door handle to the flywire door out the back), and some cool tricks and tools he has picked up along the way.

## The snake that took down a child exploitation ring
### [By Peter Yorke aka Sneaky](../speakers#peter-yorke-aka-sneaky)
In 2014, Police were alerted to an Undernet IRC channel sharing large amounts of child exploitation material (CEM). Sneaky will discuss how he automated the Police investigation using Python, MySql and a known CEM hashset to takedown multiple offenders world wide and interesting finds along the way.

## Full Mission Profiles – Intelligence-lead, scenario bound penetration testing
### [By Alex Heidenreich](../speakers#alex-heidenreich)
By looking at the cyber problem through the analogue of a modern insurgency, including the application of military targeting techniques, new insights and old truths for security (penetration) testing can be discovered and reinforced. Targeted offensive testing regimes drive efficiency, which is critical in the commercial world. This presentation will discuss methodologies to achieve this.

## Becoming Securicon Valley: A Proposal for a State-wide Development Framework
### [By Duncan Blandford (aka Axelodtl)](../speakers#duncan-blandford-aka-axelodtl)
The news is full of stories of the burgeoning skills shortage in cyber security, but collectively we have the power to change that; and to become a major part of the next wave of innovation and global ICT security leadership.  Drawing on models from elite sports and industry, this talk outlines a strategy for a state-wide program to train, equip, and network the professionals and technologists of the future; and how each of us can be both a participant in, and a beneficiary of, an abundance of local and exportable talent.

## The cyber security "skills shortage" and what does it mean for you
### [By Ricki Burke](../speakers#ricki-burke)
There are lots of headlines about a cyber security skills shortage. Initially, that sounds great but what does it mean? This presentation will focus on making yourself relevant now and over the next few years plus advice on landing a job.

## Deep Dive on the Dark Web
### [By Chester Wisniewski](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#chester-wisniewski)
Many organizations underestimate the risk of cyberattack thinking they arenâ€™t a big enough target for criminals to bother with. This presentation will demonstrate the tools available for purchase on the dark web and how easy it is to acquire them. Organizations must assess their risk accurately and understand how sophisticated adversaries are, even when they themselves donâ€™t possess high-level hacking skills. The majority will be live demos of Dark Web sites and malware creation tools.

## 117 projects later...
### [By Aaron](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#aaron)
We picked apart the 117 technical assurance projects (code reviews, VAs, pen tests, config reviews etc.) that we did across the last 12 months. This talk will present some of the findings from this analysis and give some insight into the workings of an Australian security consultancy.

## In search of remote root
### [By Osprey](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#osprey)
A remote root in the context of Android is an exploit or exploit chain which can ultimately gain full control of an Android phone remotely. This talk look's into the Android vulnerabilities which have come out over the past few years and looks into whether it is possible to chain them together to develop remote root kit.

## Do you even Cyber bro? Tales of InfoSec, Devops, and sobering lessons from cognitive science
### [By Gareth Willis](../speakers#gareth-willis)
It's 2017 and there still exists misunderstanding and even wilful antagonism between the InfoSec crowd and the DevOps team. Superficially the requirements to release often and at speed seem to run counter to the careful cadence of a strong security mandate. In reality there are significant synergies between the two disciplines but like any change a shift in thinking and a harmonisation of values are required. Factor in revelations in human rationality (or the lack thereof) from the field of cognitive science and we can strip away the veneer of entrenched behaviours and see that security and the culture of DevOps are a natural fit with one another.

## Think like a Khan, build like a Qin
### [By Josh](../speakers#josh)
How do we response to our ever changing and evolving threat environment, and the need to balance business needs and stakeholders expectations? This talk will explore such questions.

## Protecting your at-rest data from a surprisingly motivated adversary, or, why you're not paranoid enough about your disk encryption
### [By Kai Frost](../speakers#kai-frost)
Kai examines the current issues with at-rest data encryption; in particular how it relates to various world regulatory environments and the "rubber hose" issue. Over the last few months he has developed a suite of open source tools to provide plausibly self-destroying data in response to a variety of tampering events. Kai will go through the concepts of Linux based disk/volume encryption, the issues involved as a result of modern storage media and server/pc infrastructure and discuss strategies to strengthen your data paranoia.

## Google Chrome - Your newest best friend in the field
### [By Sam](../speakers#sam)
The control that extensions have over your browser and OS is downright ludicrous. After reporting a minor vulnerability in Google Chrome's handling of extensions, Sam dived headfirst into the world of extension permissions. He discovered unbelievable capability in the APIâ€™s available to Chrome extensions that are completely silent to the end-user, and yet itâ€™s an attack surface rarely used by pentesters. The data exfil, pivoting, proxying, and persistence capabilities of extensions has lead Sam to release a tool that helps pentesters build Chrome extensions with customised payloads and CnC capability. These extensions go undetected by the Chrome Web Store malware checks, and are ready for immediate deployment in the field.
He's excited to show off the tool to the public for the first time.

## 2FAssassin: Bypass 2FA, Stealing Private Keys, Abusing Client Certificates, Make Illegal Profits, Have Fun, and Much More
### [By Maxwell Koh](../speakers#maxwell-koh)
The "knowledge factor" (using passwords for authentication) will never be enough for security. We need the second layer of defense -- a "possession factor" or sometimes called the "Two-Factor Authentication", hence the term, "2FA". Nowadays many organization plans to adopt password-free login to authenticate their systems, thereby completely replacing the password-based authentication with key-based authentication, which they believed is more secure. However, the truth is far from reality.
