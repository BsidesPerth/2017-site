WACTF is run at the same time and place as BSides Perth! They are separate events though, registration to WACTF does not grant access to BSides and vice versa. Make sure to purchase a ticket if you are wanting to attend BSides Perth. The WACTF room is opposite the BSides speaking theatre, youâ€™re welcome to come and go from both events to make the most of the weekend.
