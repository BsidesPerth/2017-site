### About The UWA Cyber Security Team
Providing data protection for the University is similar to protecting a small city. Our campus includes
retail outlets with online payment facilities, research centres, libraries, HR and financial functions,
and power and energy systems as well as a geographically dispersed network with regional centres,
networks in hospitals and connections to numerous external private and government networks.

The University is an attractive target for cyber criminals given the valuable data we hold, including
staff and student personal and financial details, confidential data including medical records and
commercially desirable research.

Our objective is to continually seek the right balance of security solutions that can help our staff and
students do what they need to do in a secure and managed way without impacting on our culture of
openness and academic freedom.

We provide a range of services including attack detection and incident response, technical security
controls including anti-malware and intrusion prevention, security awareness and education and
policy and governance.
