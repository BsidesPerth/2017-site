## Deep Dive on the Dark Web
### [By Chester Wisniewski](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#chester-wisniewski)
Many organizations underestimate the risk of cyberattack thinking they arenâ€™t a big enough target for criminals to bother with. This presentation will demonstrate the tools available for purchase on the dark web and how easy it is to acquire them. Organizations must assess their risk accurately and understand how sophisticated adversaries are, even when they themselves donâ€™t possess high-level hacking skills. The majority will be live demos of Dark Web sites and malware creation tools.

## 117 projects later...
### [By Aaron](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#aaron)
We picked apart the 117 technical assurance projects (code reviews, VAs, pen tests, config reviews etc.) that we did across the last 12 months. This talk will present some of the findings from this analysis and give some insight into the workings of an Australian security consultancy.

## In search of remote root
### [By Osprey](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#Osprey)
A remote root in the context of Android is an exploit or exploit chain which can ultimately gain full control of an Android phone remotely. This talk look's into the Android vulnerabilities which have come out over the past few years and looks into whether it is possible to chain them together to develop remote root kit.

## Beauty and the Beast: Burp and its Extender
### [By Sajeeb Lohani](https://bsidesperth.com.au/speakers#sajeeb-lohani)
This talk is about Burp and its extender, including flaws & advantages of the extender, how to use it, a quick demo, some of Sajeeb's developments, and also an explanation for slightly less technical people (then it gets a bit more technical)

## Do you even Cyber bro? Tales of InfoSec, Devops, and sobering lessons from cognitive science
### [By Gareth Willis](../speakers#gareth-willis)
It's 2017 and there still exists misunderstanding and even wilful antagonism between the InfoSec crowd and the DevOps team. Superficially the requirements to release often and at speed seem to run counter to the careful cadence of a strong security mandate. In reality there are significant synergies between the two disciplines but like any change a shift in thinking and a harmonisation of values are required. Factor in revelations in human rationality (or the lack thereof) from the field of cognitive science and we can strip away the veneer of entrenched behaviours and see that security and the culture of DevOps are a natural fit with one another.

## Think like a Khan, build like a Qin
### [By Josh](../speakers#josh)
How do we response to our ever changing and evolving threat environment, and the need to balance business needs and stakeholders expectations? This talk will explore such questions.

## Protecting your at-rest data from a surprisingly motivated adversary, or, why you're not paranoid enough about your disk encryption
### [By Kai Frost](../speakers#kai-frost)
The news is full of stories of the burgeoning skills shortage in cyber security, but collectively we have the power to change that; and to become a major part of the next wave of innovation and global ICT security leadership.  Drawing on models from elite sports and industry, this talk outlines a strategy for a state-wide program to train, equip, and network the professionals and technologists of the future; and how each of us can be both a participant in, and a beneficiary of, an abundance of local and exportable talent.

## Google Chrome - Your newest best friend in the field
### [By Sam](../speakers#sam)
The control that extensions have over your browser and OS is downright ludicrous. After reporting a minor vulnerability in Google Chromeâ€™s handling of extensions, Sam dived headfirst into the world of extension permissions. He discovered unbelievable capability in the APIâ€™s available to Chrome extensions that are completely silent to the end-user, and yet itâ€™s an attack surface rarely used by pentesters. The data exfil, pivoting, proxying, and persistence capabilities of extensions has lead Sam to release a tool that helps pentesters build Chrome extensions with customised payloads and CnC capability. These extensions go undetected by the Chrome Web Store malware checks, and are ready for immediate deployment in the field.
He's excited to show off the tool to the public for the first time.
